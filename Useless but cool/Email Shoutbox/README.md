# Email shoutbox
This board is used to engage other users. Everyone can send an email to a dedicated adress and the content of the subject is displayed in a text box.

# Remarks
Nothing special to do to get it working. There's an active email adress provided (mypeakboard.com). If you like to really use this function, make sure to set up your own email adress and change the credentials of the imap server.
