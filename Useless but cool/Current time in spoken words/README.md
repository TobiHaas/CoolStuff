# Uhr mit Ansage
This board shows a cool demo on Lua scripting. It translates the current hour and minute into spoken language. Unfortunately only available in German.

# Remarks
Nothing special to do to get it working. Just hit the preview button, check out the script and learn something....
Feel free to make it nicer or translate it into a different language....
