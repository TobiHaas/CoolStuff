# Time in Spoken Word
This board shows a cool demo on Lua scripting. It translates the current hour and minute into spoken language. This board is avaliable in English and German.

# Remarks
Nothing special to do to get it working. Just hit the preview button, check out the script and learn something. It might take a second to load the time so please
be patient. Feel free to translate into another language!
