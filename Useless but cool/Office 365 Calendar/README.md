# Office 365 Calendar
This board is used to display an Office 365 Calendar within a peakboard visualization. In this case it is our events Calendar that we update frequently.

# Remarks
Nothing special to do to get it working. To change the time span of events being displayed go into the To: Code in the Calendar (Events) data source and edit the number behind "local days =".
